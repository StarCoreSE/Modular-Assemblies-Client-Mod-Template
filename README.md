# Modular-Assemblies-Client-Mod-Template

# THIS IS A TEMPLATE. [FOLLOW THE GUIDE.](https://github.com/StarCoreSE/Modular-Assemblies/wiki/Client-Mod-Template)

Hey modders!

Modular Assemblies is a mod framework designed to put the 'Engineer' back into 'Space Engineers'. It provides a simpler method of creating multiblock structures that provide added functionality, without killing performance or using esoteric vanilla tools.

This is a client mod, and must reference the original framework to function. [Check out the wiki](https://github.com/StarCoreSE/Modular-Assemblies/wiki) for more information and guides, and feel free to message [@aristeas.] [on the StarCore discord](https://discord.gg/starcore) if you have any questions or comments.

# USAGE

This template is a functional mod on its own. It can be copied into your mods folder and edited as needed, or copied into an existing mod.

Replace "YourMod" with the name of your mod, and edit `Data/Scripts/YourMod/ModularAssemblies/ExampleDefinition.cs` and `MasterDefinition.cs` to create your own assembly definitions.

A sample sessioncomponent assembly manager, `Data/Scripts/YourMod/AssemblyManager.cs` (and the other scripts in its folder), has been provided as an example for more complex assemblies. They are not required for your mod to function, and may (should) be edited to your heart's content.
